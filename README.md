# Blurer
Yet another background bluring tool when a window is active, but only with Go standard libraries-Yes it's 
a Gaussian blur that I wrote from the scratch-and XCB(not xgb the C library), so it's really light and less resource 
consumming!
It also does have more customizablity on bluring amount, increments etc. 

## Installation
only 2 things, ```XCB``` and ```Go```; simply build with Go.
